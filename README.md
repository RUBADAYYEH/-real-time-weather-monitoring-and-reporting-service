## **General Task Description:**

Design and implement a C# console application that simulates a real-time weather monitoring and reporting service. The system should be capable of receiving and processing raw weather data in multiple formats (JSON, XML, etc.) from various weather stations for different locations. The application should include different types of 'weather bots' each of which is configured to behave differently based on the weather updates it receives.The complexity of this task involves understanding and applying the Observer and Strategy design patterns, handling file input/output operations, and data manipulation for multiple formats (JSON, XML). This task simulates real-world scenarios where applications need to react to real-time data and perform different actions based on the received data and the given configuration. The application should be designed in such a way that adding new types of bots or weather data formats should not require significant changes to the existing code.
